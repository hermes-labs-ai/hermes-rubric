"""Intent-debias and scope-class preambles for rubric synthesis.

These are prepended to the framer's intent before synthesis so the
synthesizer generates dimensions appropriate to (a) the target's *kind*
(scope-class) and (b) the framer's possible bias (intent-debias).

Absorbed from ~/bin/hermes-rubric-blinded.py (the wrapper) so the
behavior is now first-class CLI surface rather than a wrapper-only
convention. See FLAGSHIP-SPEC §G7.
