"""Intent-debias and scope-class preambles for rubric synthesis.

These are prepended to a framer's intent before rubric synthesis so the
synthesizer generates dimensions appropriate to (a) the target's *kind*
(scope-class) and (b) the framer's possible bias (intent-debias).

Originally lived in hermes-rubric, then moved to hermes-blind, then vendored
back in hermes-rubric v0.2.1 so the package installs cleanly from PyPI without
a hermes-blind dependency that isn't yet on PyPI. Source-of-truth still
hermes-blind; this is a vendored copy. If the two diverge,
``tests/test_preambles_consistency.py`` will fail.
